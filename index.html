                        I am a non-binary full-stack developer with a passion for communication and a voracious hunger for learning. I believe that everyone has something to teach you, as well as something to learn from you, and that collaboration with a team always makes something greater than the sum of its parts. As a recent graduate of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, I've learned to take my skills in communication and apply them toward bridging the language barrier between people and computers. I also love Dungeons and Dragons, and firmly believe that it has made me a better coder and a better teammate.

                            The first project assigned in my GA bootcamp was to use jQuery, HTML, and CSS to create an interactive webpage which made calls to a 3rd party API and dynamically displayed the results. I created an app to pull information about enemies in Dungeons and Dragons and allow Game Masters to filter the results and add them to a table which calculates the difficulty of the proposed combat encounter.

                            For our second project, we created a full-stack application using a Mongoose, Express, and Node.js (MEN) stack. I made a mock social-networking companion app for the game Pokemon Unite with a two-model MongoDB database, allowing a user to create an account (with BCrypt password hashing), mark their favorite pokemon, and send friend requests to other users.
